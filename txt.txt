Round {current_round}/{num_reflections}. 

In your thoughts, first carefully consider the quality, novelty, and feasibility of the code generated based on the idea.  
Include any other factors that you think are important in evaluating the code.  
Ensure the code is clear, concise, and perfect.
Do not make things overly complicated.  
In the next attempt, try to refine and improve the code if needed.  
Stick to the spirit of the original idea unless there are glaring issues.

NEW CODE:  
```python
<CODE>
```

If you believe the code generated based on the idea is already excellent, simply add "I am done" at the end of your thoughts but before the code.  
ONLY INCLUDE "I am done" IF YOU ARE MAKING NO MORE CHANGES.
